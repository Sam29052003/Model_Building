# Task 4: Model Building & Forecasting

                                       Objective: Train, tune, and finalize machine learning models.

                                       Steps Performed:

                                                      Train-test split

                                                      Baseline model using Dummy Regressor

                                                      Multiple ML models:

                                                                   Linear Regression

                                                                   Decision Tree Regressor

                                                                   Random Forest Regressor

                                                                   Model comparison using MAE & RMSE

                                                                   Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

                                                                   Sklearn Pipeline creation

                                                                   Model serialization using Joblib

                                                                  Prediction export for evaluation

                                                                    Notebook:

                                                                    Task4_Model_Building.ipynb

 # Final Outputs:

                                      final_sales_forecast_model.pkl

                                      model_predictions.csv

# Model Evaluation Metrics

                                      MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

                                     RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

                                      The tuned Random Forest Regressor provided the best performance and was selected as the final model.

 # Reproducibility

                                       Folder structure maintained

                                       Pipelines used to prevent data leakage

                                       Model and predictions saved for future evaluation

# Key Learning Outcomes
